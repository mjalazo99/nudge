# nudge 👀  
**Don’t predict. Incentivize.**

Nudge is a social escrow app built on **Flow** that lets friends motivate each other with real stakes.  
Post an action, set a goal in dollars, and rally your friends to fund it. The money stays locked until it’s done — because motivation hits different when your friends are in.

## 💡 What It Is
Nudge helps people put **money where their mouth is.**

> “For $X, I will…”  
> Friends fund it → you do it → chain records it.

It’s not betting. It’s not prediction.  
It’s social accountability — powered by smart contracts.
